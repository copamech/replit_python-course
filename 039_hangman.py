- The computer will randomly select a word from the list of ten words.
- Guess one letter at time. The computer will reveal if the letter is in the word and where.
- The computer will also keep track of each or your letter guesses and how many times you've picked a letter that is not in the word.
- If you guess more than six letters that are not in the word, you lose.""")
